# Customer_Subscription_Classification

Tele Marketing has been there for a long time since the invention of electronic communication and has been serving many large organizations to gain customers attention or make them potentially invest in their campaign. My project digs deep into how the demographical information, marketing data collected pertaining to the client can be synthesized to classifying potential customers for the organization, in this case a Bank. 

Project mainly focus on, exploratory analysis of the variables and their effect on the target, in this case the customer subscription. Understanding, engineering, or generating features impacting the target variable. Pre-processing and building classification models, finally choosing the best fit model, and tuning to get the optimal efficiency. A further implementation of sampling techniques to balance the data and performance evaluation of the classification model.
